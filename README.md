==============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/robotpy/robotpy-wpilib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robotpy/robotpy-wpilib)

This repository contains the source code for a 100% python implementation of WPILib, 
the library used to interface with hardware for the FIRST Robotics Competition. 
Teams can use this library to write their robot code in Python, a powerful dynamic
programming language.
